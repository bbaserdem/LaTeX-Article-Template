	abstract = {The connections between neurons determine the computations performed by both artificial and biological neural networks. Recently, we have proposed {SYNSeq}, a method for converting the connectivity of a biological network into a form that can exploit the tremendous efficiencies of high-throughput {DNA} sequencing. In {SYNSeq}, each neuron is tagged with a random sequence of {DNA}—a “barcode”—and synapses are represented as barcode pairs. {SYNSeq} addresses the analysis problem, reducing a network into a suspension of barcode pairs. Here, we formulate a complementary synthesis problem: How can the suspension of barcode pairs be used to “clone” or copy the network back into an uninitialized tabula rasa network? Although this synthesis problem might be expected to be computationally intractable, we find that, surprisingly, this problem can be solved efficiently, using only neuron-local information. We present the “one-barcode–one-cell” ({OBOC}) algorithm, which forces all barcodes of a given sequence to coalesce into the same neuron, and show that it converges in a number of steps that is a power law of the network size. Rapid and reliable network cloning with single-synapse precision is thus theoretically possible.},

	abstract = {The structure of neuronal connectivity often provides insights into the relevant stimulus features, such as spatial location, orientation, sound frequency, etc1–6. The olfactory system, however, appears to lack structured connectivity as suggested by reports of broad and distributed connections both from the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex7–22 and within the cortex23–25. These studies have inspired computational models of circuit function that rely on random connectivity26–33. It remains, nonetheless, unclear whether the olfactory connectivity contains spatial structure. Here, we use high throughput anatomical methods ({MAPseq} and {BARseq})34–38 to analyze the projections of 5,309 bulb and 30,433 piriform cortex output neurons in the mouse at single-cell resolution. We identify previously unrecognized spatial organization in connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis (A-P) of the piriform cortex. We find that both the bulb projections to the cortex and the cortical outputs are not random, but rather form gradients along the A-P axis. Strikingly, these gradients are matched: bulb neurons targeting a given location within the piriform cortex co-innervate extra-piriform regions that receive strong inputs from neurons within that piriform locus. We also identify signatures of local connectivity in the piriform cortex. Our findings suggest an organizing principle of matched direct and indirect olfactory pathways that innervate extra-piriform targets in a coordinated manner, thus supporting models of information processing that rely on structured connectivity within the olfactory system.},
